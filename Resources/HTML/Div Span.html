    <div>Dear all,
        <span>I took this really cool course
        </span>
    </div>
    <span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
        my favorite course I've EVER taken!
        Here is the URL for it:
    </span>
    <a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
    <div>
        Does anyone know how I can give this course 6
        out of 5 stars?
    </div>
    <div>
        Thank you,
        -Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
    </div>
